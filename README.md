Using player data from NBA seasons 1997-98 through 2021-22, our goal was to gain insights into trends in performance. By comparing statistics like Points Scored, Field Goal Percentage, and Rebounds across different groupings (i.e. Age, Position, Season), some insightful information appears.

We measured general performance by comparing these same statistics across the our differentiating groups:
Minutes Played
Points Scored
Rebounds
Free Throw Percentage (Free Throws Made vs. Attempted
Field Goal Percentage (Non-Free Throw Shots Made vs Attempted

We then applied those comparisons by asking:
Does age affect performance?
Are players more or less aggressive in different positions?
How do statistics vary across position groups?
How has player performance changed over time?

The player statistical data was acquired from a database in Kaggle, which was originally scraped from basketball-reference.com. The data consists of 14,573 player entries (2,374 unique players) and forty-four different statistics by which they are measured.

To view the dashboard, click the link here at the top of the README file. The dashboard has two drop-down menus. The top menu changes the inputs for the top two and bottom left chart. The bottom right chart has its own drop-down menu with separate inputs. The code for the project is titled project3_script.ipynb and includes all of the visualizations. There is a Resources directory that has the js files for the dashboard, SQL files & a database, as well as csv files of the pre & post cleaning of data. 

Ethical considerations:
While there are certainly ethical considerations regarding the use of player biometric data, the data used in this project does not carry those same concerns. Player performance statistics like points, minutes, and rebounds can be counted by anyone with access to the game (the general public) and are not considered private or sensitive. As "analytics" in sports continue to incorporate player positioning and biometric data, however, there will be increasing concerns regarding who can access/use the data and to what purpose.
